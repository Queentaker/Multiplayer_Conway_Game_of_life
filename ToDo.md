### Softcon_Assignment-3
here is a list of what needs to be done apart from testing


- Make sure to look at crc cards for further information and to see what needs to be implemented üòÅ

## Grid
- [ ] stats whenever evolved stats need to change and when player adds and removes gridcells: observer necessary
- [ ] the stats need to keep track of how many cells each player has and in which gernation we are
- [ ] create 4-6 template patterns that are legal
- [ ] make grid and templates work together
- [ ] not necessary create grititerator that returns list of neighbors
- [ ] if done so change grid to be flexibale to recantangle
- [ ] nextgen needs to count the cells when evolving 

## Gameflow

- [ ] create setup that checks input and then creates the players and the grid with wished size
- [ ] in order to do that make grid 
- [ ] turnflow meaning switch turn after player has removed and then added cell
- [ ] make gamemanger singleton
- [ ] manage players turn
- [ ] have turn ask player which cells he wants to remove and then add
- [ ] not much has been implemented of gamemanger look at crc card is in whatsapp chat
- [ ] turn should be able to give the name of the current player
- [ ] make the desion choice if setup passes its information to the gamemanger or the gamemanger has an instance of setup. 

### Player
- [ ] human player get input from gui and pass it 
- [ ] abstract player has place and delete cell function, human player implements these
